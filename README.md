# Seasonal-Trend decomposition based on Loess + Machine Learning: Hybrid Forecasting for Monthly Univariate Time Series

This repository contains the code for the experiments regarding the combination of machine learning regression models and the STL decomposition algorithm for monthly univariate time series forecasting. The results were presented on the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 2021 and the link for the published paper can be found here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9533644
